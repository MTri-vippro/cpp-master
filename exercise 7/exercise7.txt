Leap Year Checker

Create a program that takes a year as input and determines if it is a leap year. Use if-else statements to check the conditions:

	â€¢	A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except when it is also divisible by 400.

Test Cases:

	1.	Input: 2000 | Output: 2000 is a leap year
	2.	Input: 1900 | Output: 1900 is not a leap year
	3.	Input: 2024 | Output: 2024 is a leap year
	4.	Input: 2023 | Output: 2023 is not a leap year
