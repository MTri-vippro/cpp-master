Write a function named swap that takes two integer references and swaps their values. Test this function in the main function by passing two integer variables.




int x = 5, y = 10;
swap(x, y);
cout << "Test Case 1: " << (x == 10 && y == 5) << endl;
int a = 0, b = -1;
swap(a, b);
cout << "Test Case 2: " << (a == -1 && b == 0) << endl;
