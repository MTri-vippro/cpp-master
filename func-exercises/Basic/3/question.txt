Create two overloaded functions named multiply. One should take two integers, and the other should take two doubles. Both functions should return the product of their parameters. Demonstrate calling both functions in the main function.



// Test cases for the multiply function
cout << "Test Case 1: " << (multiply(3, 4) == 12) << endl;
cout << "Test Case 2: " << (multiply(2.5, 3.2) == 8.0) << endl;
cout << "Test Case 3: " << (multiply(-2, -3) == 6) << endl;
