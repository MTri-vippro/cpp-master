Exercise 1: Pointer Initialization
- Declare an integer variable and a pointer to that integer. Initialize the pointer and print the value using the pointer.

Example Output:
Value of num: 10

Exercise 2: Pointer and Array
- Create an array of 5 integers. Use a pointer to traverse and print each element of the array.

Example Output:
Array elements: 1 2 3 4 5

Exercise 3: Pointer to Pointer
- Declare an integer variable, a pointer to that integer, and a pointer to the pointer. Print the value using the pointer to pointer.

Example Output:
Value of num using ptr2: 20

Exercise 4: Pointer Arithmetic
- Declare an array of 5 integers. Use pointer arithmetic to print the address of each element in the array.

Example Output:
Addresses of array elements:
0x7ffee5d24a40
0x7ffee5d24a44
0x7ffee5d24a48
0x7ffee5d24a4c
0x7ffee5d24a50

Exercise 5: Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Write a program that dynamically allocates memory for an integer, assigns a value, and prints it. Then, free the allocated memory.

Example Output:
Value of dynamically allocated integer: 42

Exercise 6: Array of Pointers
- Create an array of pointers to integers. Allocate memory for each pointer, assign values, and print them.

Example Output:
Values of array elements:
10
20
30
40
50

Exercise 7: Function with Pointer Parameter
- Write a function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter, modifies the value, and prints the result in the main function.

Example Output:
Value after modification: 15

Exercise 8: Pointer to Structure
- Define a structure with two members. Declare a pointer to the structure, allocate memory, assign values to the members, and print them.

Example Output:
Structure values:
Name: John
Age: 25

Exercise 9: Pointer to Const
- Declare a constant integer and a pointer to that constant integer. Try to modify the value through the pointer and observe the result.

Example Output:
Error: assignment of read-only location

Exercise 10: Const Pointer
- Declare an integer variable and a constant pointer to that variable. Modify the value of the variable through the pointer.

Example Output:
Value of num: 30
