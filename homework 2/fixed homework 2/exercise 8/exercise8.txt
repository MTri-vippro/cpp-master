ATM Machine Simulation

Write a program to simulate an ATM machine. The program should allow the user to perform the following operations:

	1.	Check balance
	2.	Deposit money
	3.	Withdraw money
	4.	Exit

Use switch case to handle the different operations. Initialize the balance to 1000.

Test Cases:

	1.	Initial balance: 1000
	•	Operation: Check balance | Output: Your balance is 1000
	•	Operation: Deposit 500 | Output: Deposit successful. Your balance is 1500
	•	Operation: Withdraw 200 | Output: Withdrawal successful. Your balance is 1300
	•	Operation: Withdraw 1500 | Output: Insufficient balance
	•	Operation: Exit
